README_BBCodeParser
-------------------

These notes introduce the changes in HTML_BBCodeParser refunded on Text_Wiki

1) PEAR static properties
Options can still be initialized thru PEAR static properties,
however this feature is deprecated.
You may define the constant HTML_BBCODEPARSER_V2 to avoid requiring PEAR
and shut off totally this feature

2) Droped out options
* Open/close tags
        'open'          => '['
        'close'         => ']'
  The tags are fixed to square brackets, if different rejected
* XHTML compatibility
  The rendering is exlusively XHTML, so old rendering options are fixed :
        'quotestyle'    => 'double',
        'quotewhat'     => 'all',
        'xmlclose'      => true,
  Differents will be ignored.

3) Choice of filters/rules
The option 'filters' is still in use
 'filters' => 'Basic,Extended,Links,Images,Lists,Email' (default 'Basic')
and will determine the list of active rules (tags) as usual

It's a way of grouping rules and you may prefer the option 'rules'
which enables a detailed list of activated tags.
You can use both 'filters' and 'rules', they are additive.

NOTE: as for the initial release, only standard BBCode tags are implemented
in the parser. Therefore, [s], [sub], [sup], [font], [align] and [ulist]
even if they exist in the renderer are not yet implemented in the parser

4) New options
* General
The 'filters' and 'rules' options detail the enabled tags
* Parser
The 'parser_BBCode_xxx' options cares for Text_Wiki_Parse_BBCode options for rule/tag xxx
* Renderer
Then 'render_Xhtml_xxx' options cares for Text_Wiki_Render_Xhtml options for rule/tag xxx
